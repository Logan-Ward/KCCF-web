---

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x and npm 10+
- Git for version control

## Quick Start (Local Development)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with Turbopack
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root for local development (do not commit this file):
```env
# Optional: Set to 'production' to enable search engine indexing
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_ENV=development

# Optional: Override base path for deployment testing
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=
```
Notes:
- The site uses Zeffy for donations which doesn't require API keys
- Cookie consent and theme preferences are managed client-side
- All form integrations use Monday.com embedded iframes (no API keys needed)

## Project Scripts
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server with Turbopack |
| `npm run build` | Production build (static export to `out/` directory) |
| `npm run start` | Start the production server locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint code quality checks |

## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### CI/CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/nextjs.yml`)
The main workflow runs on every push and pull request:

**On Pull Requests:**
- Lint checks (ESLint)
- TypeScript compilation check (`tsc --noEmit`)
- Production build verification

**On Push to Main:**
- All CI checks above
- Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

### Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)
CodeQL Advanced security scanning runs:
- On every push to main
- On every pull request to main
- Weekly scheduled scans (Mondays at 1:28 AM UTC)

**Languages analyzed:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- GitHub Actions workflows

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### How Deployment Works
1. CI workflow runs lint, type-check, and build
2. Static site is generated in the `out/` directory
3. Artifact is uploaded to GitHub Pages
4. Site is live at `https://thekccf.org`

### Manual Deployment
You can trigger a deployment manually from the GitHub Actions tab using "workflow_dispatch".

## Docker (Development/Testing)
A Dockerfile is included for containerized development or testing:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t kccf-web .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 kccf-web
```
**Note:** The included Dockerfile is configured for standalone server output (e.g., running `server.js`), not for serving the static export generated by `output: 'export'` in `next.config.ts`. If you wish to containerize the static export (the contents of the `out/` directory), you will need to update the Dockerfile accordingly (e.g., use an Nginx or static file server image). Production deployment uses GitHub Pages, not Docker containers.

### Adding New Forms

   ```typescript
   export type FormType = 
     | 'camp-camper'
     | 'your-new-form' // Add here
   ```

2. **Add form configuration** to `FORM_CONFIGS` object:
   ```typescript
   'your-new-form': {
     title: 'Your Form Title',
     subtitle: 'Optional description for users',
     src: 'https://forms.monday.com/forms/embed/YOUR_FORM_ID',
     height: '1500px' // Adjust based on form length
   }
   ```

3. **Use FormButton** component on any page:
   ```tsx
   <FormButton formType="your-new-form" variant="violet" size="lg">
     Button Text
   </FormButton>
   ```

6. **External Verification**: Check the appropriate external service (Monday.com, Mailchimp, Zeffy, or GiveLively)

### Key Testing Notes
- **All 10 forms are production-ready** and actively used
- **No custom HTML forms** exist on the site - all forms use external services
- **Cookie consent is mandatory** for all forms to display
- **Modal forms (8 of 10)** open in responsive overlays with consistent UX
- **Donation form is unique** as it offers two provider options (Zeffy embedded, GiveLively redirect)
- **Peer-to-peer fundraisers** page provides full-page embedded Zeffy platform with leaderboard
- **File uploads** are handled within Monday.com forms (notably aid application)
- **No server-side form processing** on KCCF website - all handled by external services

### Form Troubleshooting

| Form not loading | Check external service URLs are accessible |
| Submission not working | Verify on external service dashboard |
| Cookie banner not appearing | Clear browser storage and reload in incognito mode |

## SEO optimization
The site is optimized for corporate partnerships and CSR programs:

### Corporate volunteering SEO
- **Target keywords**: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), employee volunteering, volunteer days, VTO, workplace giving programs, team-building volunteer events
- **Primary pages**: Crazy Socks (gift bag volunteering), Volunteer (corporate programs), Contact (partnerships)
- **Content strategy**: SEO-optimized paragraphs with keyword integration on key pages
- **Metadata structure**: Each page has dedicated layout.tsx files with targeted meta descriptions and keywords

### File upload configuration (Legacy - Now Modal-Based)
The aid application previously included a complex multi-step form. It's now simplified to use Monday.com forms via modal system.

### Development
- Forms are now handled via Monday.com embedded iframes in modals
- No local file handling required for most forms
- Aid applications use Monday.com form with built-in file upload capabilities

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Port already in use | Stop other services using port 3000 or use a different port |
| ESLint warnings during build | `next.config.ts` allows builds to complete; run `npm run lint` locally to fix issues |
| Node version mismatch | Ensure Node 20.x is installed locally (use `node -v` to check) |
| Dark mode not working | Check `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` and ensure theme toggle is properly connected |
| Cookie consent issues | Verify `src/contexts/CookieConsentContext.tsx` is properly initialized in layout |
| Donation modal not loading | Ensure marketing cookies are enabled in cookie preferences |
| Form modals not opening | Verify `FormModalProvider` is wrapped in layout and `FormModal` component is included |
| Form modal scrolling issues | Check modal height settings in `FormModal.tsx` |
| Monday.com forms not loading | Ensure marketing cookies are enabled and form URLs are correct in `FormModalContext.tsx` |
| Build fails on GitHub Actions | Check workflow logs in Actions tab; verify Node version matches (20.x) |
| GitHub Pages deployment fails | Ensure the `ci` job passes; check permissions and Pages configuration |
